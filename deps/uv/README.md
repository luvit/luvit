# libuv

libuv is a multi-platform support library with a focus on asynchronous I/O. It
was primarily developed for use by [Node.js](http://node.js.org), but it's also
used by Mozilla's [Rust language](http://www.rust-lang.org/),
[Luvit](http://luvit.io/), [Julia](http://julialang.org/),
[pyuv](https://crate.io/packages/pyuv/), and others.

## Feature highlights

 * Full-featured event loop backed by epoll, kqueue, IOCP, event ports.

 * Asynchronous TCP and UDP sockets

 * Asynchronous DNS resolution

 * Asynchronous file and file system operations

 * File system events

 * ANSI escape code controlled TTY

 * IPC with socket sharing, using Unix domain sockets or named pipes (Windows)

 * Child processes

 * Thread pool

 * Signal handling

 * High resolution clock

 * Threading and synchronization primitives

## Build Instructions

For GCC there are two methods building: via autotools or via [GYP][].
GYP is a meta-build system which can generate MSVS, Makefile, and XCode
backends. It is best used for integration into other projects.

To build with autotools:

    $ sh autogen.sh
    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ make check
    $ make install

### Windows

First, Python 2.6 or 2.7 must be installed as it is required by [GYP][].

Also, the directory for the preferred Python executable must be specified
by the `PYTHON` or `Path` environment variables.

To build with Visual Studio, launch a git shell (e.g. Cmd or PowerShell)
and run vcbuild.bat which will checkout the GYP code into build/gyp and
generate uv.sln as well as related project files.

To have GYP generate build script for another system, checkout GYP into the
project tree manually:

    $ mkdir -p build
    $ git clone https://git.chromium.org/external/gyp.git build/gyp

### Unix

Run:

    $ ./gyp_uv -f make
    $ make -C out

### OS X

Run:

    $ ./gyp_uv -f xcode
    $ xcodebuild -project uv.xcodeproj -configuration Release -target All

### Android

Run:

    $ source ./android-configure NDK_PATH gyp
    $ make -C out

Note for UNIX users: compile your project with `-D_LARGEFILE_SOURCE` and
`-D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64`. GYP builds take care of that automatically.

## Supported Platforms

Microsoft Windows operating systems since Windows XP SP2. It can be built
with either Visual Studio or MinGW. Consider using
[Visual Studio Express 2010][] or later if you do not have a full Visual
Studio license.

Linux using the GCC toolchain.

OS X using the GCC or XCode toolchain.

Solaris 121 and later using GCC toolchain.
