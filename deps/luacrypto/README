LuaCrypto provides a Lua frontend to the OpenSSL cryptographic library.
The OpenSSL features that are currently exposed are digests (MD5, SHA-1,
HMAC, and more) and crypto-grade random number generators.

LuaCrypto also supports encryption and decryption, signing and verifying, sealing and opening using the OpenSSL EVP API.
